The purpose of the package "BaseballStatCalc" is to allow the user to quickly and efficiently calculate key metrics for baseball players of various types
from input count data.

BaseballStatCalc consists of a main class "Player" that consists of the following input parameters: name, age, team. This class is then inherited by two
player types in subpackages: "Offensive" and "Defensive". Each of these player types have their own input parameters.

For Offensive players: atbats, hits, homeruns, doubles, triples, errors, fieldingattempts
For Defensive players: inningspitched, strikeouts, walks

The Offensive player type has two modules: batting.py and fielding.py. batting.py calculates the following metrics: battingaverage, onbasepercentage,
sluggingpercentage. fielding.py calculates the following metrics: fieldingpercentage

The Defensive player type has one module: pitching.py. pitching.py calculates the following metrics: EarnedRunAverage, WalksHitsPerInningsPitched,
StrikeoutsPer9, WalksPer9.

The Defensive class is then inherited by two types in subpackages: "Starter" and "Reliever". Each of these player types have the following input parameters.

For Relievers: saves, holds, saveholdchances
For Starters: gamesstarted

Relievers contain a module called reliever.py, which contains the metric: convertedsaves. Starters contain a module called starter.py,
